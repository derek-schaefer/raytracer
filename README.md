# Ray Tracer

[Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) (with Go)

This project will contain my implementation journey of working through the linked resource.

The deliverable will be a program that can perform basic ray tracing operations (actually path tracing as noted in the article) and produce the results as static images.

Instead of using C++ as in the linked resource, I'll be using Go. My motivations for undertaking this effort are to refamiliarize myself with Go, as well as learn about ray tracing and related graphical concepts.

Let's get tracing!
